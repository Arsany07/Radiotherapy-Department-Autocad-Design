# Radiotherapy-Department-Autocad-Design
This is a design of a radiotherapy department for hospitals, covering area, architecture, equipment, facilities, budget, safety, IT integration, and standards.

### 1. Area and Size
- **Area**: 1407.6724 mÂ²
- **Perimeter**: 216.2432 m

### 2. Architecture Design
- Layout plan available at: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VdgM6Qk_2-QI27XNfUwDGBiUmhKNhSLl/view?usp=drive_link)

### 3. Equipment
- **Essential Radiotherapy**: Linear Accelerator (LINAC), Treatment Planning System (TPS), Oncology Information System (OIS), High Dose Rate (HDR) Brachytherapy Unit, dosimeters, phantoms, ionization chambers.
- **Imaging/Diagnostic**: CT Scanner, MRI Scanner, Ultrasound, X-ray Machine.
- **Support/Safety**: Radiation shielding, patient immobilization devices, radiation monitoring, UPS systems.

### 4. Required Facilities
- **Electrical**: Three-phase power, backup generators, UPS for critical systems.
- **Water**: Supply for cooling, sanitation; proper drainage.
- **Medical Gases**: Oxygen, vacuum, compressed air for procedures.
- **HVAC**: Stable temperature/humidity, HEPA filtration for specific rooms.
- **IT/Communication**: Network cabling, intercoms, HIS integration, UPS for IT systems.

### 5. Budget
- **Total Estimated Cost**: $8.031 million
  - Essential Radiotherapy: $2.955 million (e.g., Varian TrueBeam LINAC: $1.5M, HDR Brachytherapy: $1.4M)
  - Imaging Equipment: $4.8 million (e.g., Siemens SOMATOM Force CT: $2M, Philips Ingenia 3T MRI: $2.5M)
  - Support/Safety: $276,000

### 6. Safety Design
- **Radiation Protection**: Concrete/lead shielding, maze entryways, interlocked doors, warning systems.
- **Fire Safety**: Alarms, extinguishers, radiation-compatible smoke detectors.
- **Security**: Access control, CCTV, intrusion alarms for radioactive source areas.

### 7. Hospital Information System (HIS) Integration
- **Features**: Interoperability (HL7, DICOM), data flow, reliability, role-based access, security (HIPAA/GDPR), scalability.
- **Infrastructure**: Workstations, servers (database, application, backup), networking (switches, firewalls), secure Wi-Fi, UPS.
- **UI Components**: Patient demographics, treatment schedules, imaging access.

### 8. Design Standards
- **References**: IAEA Safety Reports (No. 47, 63), TECDOC-1540, national codes.
- **Zoning**: Controlled (treatment) and supervised (corridors, control rooms) areas.
- **Scalability**: Designed for equipment access, maintenance, and future expansion.
- **Infection Control**: Hospital-grade materials, ventilation, patient privacy.

### 9. References
- IAEA reports, Varian, Elekta, Siemens, Philips, GE product documentation, and other technical resources.

This design ensures a functional, safe, and scalable radiotherapy department tailored to clinical and regulatory requirements.
